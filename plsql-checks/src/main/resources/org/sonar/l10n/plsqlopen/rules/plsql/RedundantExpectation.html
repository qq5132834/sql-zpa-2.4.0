<p>From the <a href="http://utplsql.org/utPLSQL/latest/userguide/expectations.html">utPLSQL documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  Validation of the code under test (the tested logic of procedure/function etc.) is performed by comparing
  the actual data against the expected data. utPLSQL uses a combination of expectation and matcher to
  perform the check on the data.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Some validations are written in the form of <code>ut.expect(actual_value).matcher(expected_value)</code>.
  This rules checks if the <code>actual_value</code> and the <code>expected_value</code> are the same thing. Example:
</p>

<pre>
...
begin
  v_expected := '2345';
  v_actual := betwnstr('1234567', 2, 5);
  ut.expect(v_actual).to_equal(v_actual); -- This expectation is wrong, it's always true
end;
</pre>
